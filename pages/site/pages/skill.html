			<p class="write-p">What can I do?<br>
I can take care about design, animations in CSS3, shape and seating in page, in other words I can create a website alone starting from 0. I have a full imagination, and this thing make me to have many ideas such that the site appearance to be remarkable and original. Instead, all I must to do is to perfect myself in JavaScript language, for animations creating that cannot be create with CSS3, and also to perfect in Photoshop.

			<h1 class="write-h1">My first website</h1>
			<p class="write-p">My first website was in highschool. I started to learn html and CSS on w3school, copying and trying to understand what happens there, especially into animation with CSS3. I made a website for one of my friend which is photographer, making a carousel, a gallery and a contact page. After a while I realized that on w3school some complex codes are written with boostrap and I started to learn myself and searching on google how to write code from 0 without using boostrap, because I wanted to learn everything regarding to this. </p>

			<p class="write-p">
				"The mother of learning is exercising" - this saying is so true. Now, I now how to play with CSS/CSS3 animation [keyframes] and even with responsive, without using boostrap. The harder thing regarding to responsive, when you don't use boostrap, is that you need almost to "re-make" the entire website. When you see that a container is overflow on a specific width, you need to set through @media only and screen(widt:?){} again a specific width to that container. When the container will reach that width set by you, then will change in the width again set by you. The principle itself it's not hard but you need to write it over and over again until reach the perfect value.<br>
				Now, the only thing I want is to learn very well javascript, because everytime I see on awwwards-websites so gorgeous made, I wish in one day I make websites like pro.

				Short opinion

			<p class="write-p">From my point of view, doesn't matter what you learn, but after you catch the idea how it works the most beautiful thing is that you can play with everything you've learned and if you let the imagination to flow through your mind then you can create wonderful things.</p>
